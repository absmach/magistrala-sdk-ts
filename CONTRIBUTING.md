Before raising a new issue, check [our issue

problem that you are facing.

report:

- What were you trying to achieve?

- What are the received results?
- What are the steps to reproduce the issue?
- In what environment did you encounter the issue?

## Pull requests

Good pull requests (e.g. patches, improvements, new features) are a fantastic help. They should
remain focused in scope and avoid unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing new features,
refactoring code etc.), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
maintainers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the project.
